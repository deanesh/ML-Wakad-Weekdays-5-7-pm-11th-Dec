    "**Justification of Difficulty**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Q1 (Organic):** Multi-step deduction of structures from reactions (LiAlH₄ reduction indicates carbonyl, no Tollen's rules out aldehyde → likely ketone). Formation of alkene B → C, ozonolysis to only benzaldehyde indicates symmetrical alkene with phenyl groups. Racemic mixture with Br₂ indicates chiral centers. Determining stereoisomers needs structure elucidation + stereochemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Q2 (Kinetics):** Consecutive first-order reactions. Need formula for time when [B] is max: \\( t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\ln(k_2/k_1)}{k_2 - k_1} \\). Substitution yields \\( t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{10^{-3}} = 1000 \\ln 2 \\) seconds — but careful: \\( k_2 > k_1 \\) changes nothing in formula except sign in denominator? Actually \\( t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{k_2 - k_1} \\ln \\frac{k_2}{k_1} = \\frac{1}{10^{-3}} \\ln 2 = 1000 \\ln 2 \\) s. Answer matches option (C).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Q3 (Chemical Bonding):** Requires knowledge of geometry (tetrahedral vs square planar for Ni²⁺), electron configuration, magnetic behavior. CN⁻ strong field ligand causes square planar diamagnetic in Ni²⁺ (d⁸). Cl⁻ weak field → tetrahedral paramagnetic for Ni²⁺. Mn²⁺ (d⁵) weak field → tetrahedral paramagnetic. Fe²⁺ (d⁶) strong field CN⁻ → low spin octahedral diamagnetic but geometry not tetrahedral. So only Ni(CN)₄²⁻ is diamagnetic but square planar → so tetrahedral diamagnetic species = 0. Tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Q4 (Coordination Compounds):** Tests isomerism, precipitation behavior (only 1 Cl⁻ precipitated indicates one Cl⁻ is ionizable, other is coordinated differently), and subsequent organic reactions indicating formation of aromatic amine after reduction (reduction of nitro? Wait, original complex has Co³⁺? Likely original complex is Co(III) with two Cl⁻, one ionizable). Reducing with Zn/Hg+HCl reduces Co? Actually reduces nitro to amino if nitro compound was formed from reaction after replacement? This is actually testing sequencing: the complex after AgNO₃ loses one Cl⁻, then reduced to Co²⁺, ligand substitution yields free aromatic amine (if ammine ligands were substituted by aromatic amine earlier?). Actually, the orange-red dye with NaNO₂ + β-naphthol indicates primary aromatic amine formed after reduction, meaning one NH₃ got replaced by aryl amine after some step — complicated. Focus: only certain isomers give 1 mole AgCl precipitate (cis isomer with both Cl⁻ trans? No, trans isomer gives both Cl⁻ equivalent; if both Cl⁻ are equivalent, both would be precipitated? Not necessarily; in trans-[Co(NH₃)₄Cl₂]⁺, both Cl⁻ are equally bound, but maybe only one is ionizable quickly? Actually, in trans isomer, both Cl⁻ are in same environment, so both should be equally replaceable. But if one is precipitated by AgNO₃ quickly, the other may remain coordinated — thus only 1 Cl⁻ precipitated means one Cl⁻ is loosely bound (ionizable) and the other is tightly bound (non-labile) — possible in mixed ligand complexes but here ligands are same for Cl⁻. So likely the complex is actually [Co(NH₃)₅Cl]²⁺ type? But formula says [Co(NH₃)₄Cl₂]⁺. Maybe the data implies cis isomer where one Cl⁻ is trans to NH₃ (more labile) and one trans to Cl⁻ (less labile)? But in octahedral, trans effect matters for substitution kinetics, but AgNO₃ precipitation test is for ionizable chloride ions. Usually, both chlorides in [Co(NH₃)₄Cl₂]⁺ are ionizable in aqueous solution over time. So if only one precipitates immediately, means one is in coordination sphere less labile? Possibly the complex is actually a chloro-bridged dimer? This makes it hard.\n",

    "5. **Q5 (p-Block):** Classical qualitative analysis puzzle — white solid → heating → CO₂ (lime water milky) + alkaline residue (CaO) from CaCO₃. But passing CO₂ through alkaline solution R (Ca(OH)₂) gives Ca(HCO₃)₂ (S). Heating S gives back CO₂ and CaCO₃. That fits CaCO₃ as P. But check other options: NaHCO₃ heating gives CO₂ + Na₂CO₃ (R, alkaline), passing CO₂ through Na₂CO₃ gives NaHCO₃ (S), heating S again gives back CO₂ + Na₂CO₃. So both CaCO₃ and NaHCO₃ fit partially, but in CaCO₃, residue is CaO, dissolving in water gives Ca(OH)₂ (R), passing excess CO₂ gives Ca(HCO₃)₂, heating that gives CaCO₃ + CO₂ + H₂O, so P is regenerated? No, Ca(HCO₃)₂ heating gives CaCO₃ (not original P directly?) Actually, Ca(HCO₃)₂ → CaCO₃ + CO₂ + H₂O, so Q is CO₂ again. That matches. For NaHCO₃: P is NaHCO₃, heating → Na₂CO₃ + CO₂ + H₂O, Na₂CO₃ dissolved in water (R alkaline), excess CO₂ gives NaHCO₃ (S), heating S gives Na₂CO₃ + CO₂ — but here S is NaHCO₃, same as P! So that also fits \"heating S gives back Q (CO₂)\". The problem: the residue after heating P dissolves to give alkaline solution — in CaCO₃ case, residue CaO reacts with water to give Ca(OH)₂ (alkaline). In NaHCO₃, residue is Na₂CO₃ dissolving to give alkaline solution.  \n",
    "But for CaCO₃, the S is Ca(HCO₃)₂, heating gives CO₂ and CaCO₃ — but original P was CaCO₃, so P regenerated. For NaHCO₃, S is NaHCO₃, so P regenerated directly. But the flow: P →(heat)→ Q + residue →(dissolve residue)→ R →(excess CO₂)→ S →(heat)→ Q again. Both fit. Need distinguishing factor: In CaCO₃ heating, residue is CaO, dissolving in water gives Ca(OH)₂ (R), excess CO₂ gives Ca(HCO₃)₂ (S). In NaHCO₃, residue Na₂CO₃, excess CO₂ gives NaHCO₃ (S).  \n",
    "Given options, which one is commonly asked? Typically this sequence is for CaCO₃ because of lime water test + bicarbonate formation from hydroxide + CO₂.\n",
