If the normals to the parabola at \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) intersect at point \\( R \\), and \\( \\triangle PQR \\) is equilateral, then the area of \\( \\triangle PQR \\) is:\n",

    "**Justification of Difficulty**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Q1 (Conics):** Combines parabola, circle through focus and vertex, normals meeting, and equilateral triangle condition — needs parametric coordinates manipulation, properties of normals, and geometry of normals intersection, leading to solving for parameter \\( a \\) and area calculation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Q2 (Integral Calculus):** Involves differentiation under integral sign (Leibniz) to find maxima of an integral function with exponential and polynomial integrand; requires solving \\( f'(x)=0 \\) and analyzing sign changes of derivative, which reduces to solving \\( e^{x^2}(x^4 - 2x^2 + 3) = 0 \\) but careful: derivative \\( f'(x) = e^{x^2}(x^4 - 2x^2 + 3) \\) is always positive, hence no maxima — tricky to realize without computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Q3 (Complex Numbers):** Conditions imply roots of unity properties; \\( z_1, z_2, z_3 \\) vertices of equilateral triangle on unit circle, additional condition \\( z_1^4 + z_2^4 + z_3^4 = 0 \\) must be consistent. Then sum of squares of side lengths needed; yields a constant independent of orientation — involves symmetry and algebra of cube roots of unity or \\( 120^\\circ \\) separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Q4 (3D Geometry):** Requires checking coplanarity, finding plane equation containing two skew lines, using given point condition to fix plane parameter, then distance from center to that plane is radius of sphere — multi-step with analytical geometry and sphere equation.\n",
